A fuction calling itself in its own body is called a recursive fuction.
Few recursive fuctions are factorial function,ackermann fuction,tower of hanoi,fibonacci series.
A recursive function has two parts.
i)base condition or terminating condition: there must be a reachable condition for function termination otherwise the fuction will be invoked endlessly. 
ii)recursive call: the solution is divided into simpler parts. The result is obtained by combining the solutions of all these simpler parts.
Thus, one can say recursion is an example of divide and conquer method.
