Ackermann function A(m,n) is a function with two parameters m and n. Both m and n are non negative integers.It uses the concept of recursion.
It is defined as follows:
i)If m=0, then A(m,n)=n+1
ii)If m!=0 and n=0, then A(m,n)=A(m-1,1)
iii)If m!=0 and n!=0, then A(m,n)=A(m-1,A(m,n-1)
Ackermann function grows quickly.
