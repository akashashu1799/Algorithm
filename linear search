Let arr be an array comprising of n elements.The objective is to search for a given key in arr.
We compare the key with each element of arr.If found ,the position of the element is returned.
At the end of this process,if key not found in arr then -1 is returned.
This method which traverses arr sequentially to search key is known as linear search.
In the main function, if key found then the position is printed.
Otherwise, unsuccessful search is printed.
