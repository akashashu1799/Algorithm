Selection sort is a sorting technique whose main idea is to select the smallest element in the unsorted array repeatedly.
The smallest element of unsorted array selected is swapped with the first element of the unsorted array.
If there are n elements then the array can be sorted in n-1 passes.
In each pass, the smallest element of unsorted array is exchanged with first element of unsorted array.
